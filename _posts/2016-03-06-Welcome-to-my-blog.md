The purpose of this blog is for me to have somewhere to share some of the experiences I have gone through and the skills I have gained during my adventure as a software developer. 

### About Me

My name is Andrew Campbell. I recently graduated from Webster University with a B.S in Computer Science. I am currently looking for a job as a software developer in the St. Louis area.
